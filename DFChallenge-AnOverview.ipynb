    "\n",
    "[**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/) is an **AirBnB for Data Scientists** – this is where they spend their nights and weekends. It’s a crowd-sourced platform to attract, nurture, train and challenge data scientists from all around the world to solve data science, machine learning and predictive analytics problems. It has over 536,000 active members from 194 countries and it receives close to 150,000 submissions per month. Started from Melbourne, Australia Kaggle moved to Silicon Valley in 2011, raised some 11 million dollars from the likes of Hal Varian (Chief Economist at Google), Max Levchin (Paypal), Index and Khosla Ventures and then ultimately been acquired by the Google in March of 2017. Kaggle is the number one stop for data science enthusiasts all around the world who compete for prizes and boost their Kaggle rankings. There are only 94 Kaggle Grandmasters in the world to this date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you know that most data scientists are only theorists and rarely get a chance to practice before being employed in the real-world? Kaggle solves this problem by giving data science enthusiasts a platform to interact and compete in solving real-life problems. The experience you get on Kaggle is invaluable in preparing you to understand what goes into finding feasible solutions for big data.\n",

    "Deepfakes are fakes generated by deep learning. So far so easy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This usually means someone used a generative model like an [*AutoEncoder*](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/unsupervised/Autoencoders/) or most likely a [*Generative Adversarial Network*](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf), short **GAN**. GANs are technically two networks that work against each other, illustrated below. The *artist* (**generator**) draws its inspiration from a noise sample and creates a rendering of the data you are trying to generate with said GAN. The private *investigator* (**discriminator**) randomly gets assigned real and fake data to investigate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The learning process is collaborative. The generator gets better at fooling the discriminator and the discriminator gets better at figuring out which data is real and which isn't. In mathematical terms they are learning until a [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) is reached, which means neither can learn new tricks and get better. They're a really cool concept and even used in scientific simulation at [CERN](https://indico.cern.ch/event/595059/contributions/2497383/attachments/1431666/2199445/gan_presentation_IML.pdf).\n",

This has become a very popular area of research, warranting a [GAN Zoo](https://github.com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo) of all named GANs.

    "\n",
    "**Training Set:** This dataset, containing labels for the target, is available for download for competitors to build their models. It is broken up into 50 files, for ease of access and download. Due to its large size, it must be accessed through a GCS bucket which is only made available to participants after accepting the competition’s rules. Please read the rules fully before accessing the dataset, as they contain important details about the dataset’s permitted use. *It is expected and encouraged that you train your models outside of Kaggle’s notebooks environment and submit to Kaggle by uploading the trained model as an external data source.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public Validation Set:** When you commit your Kaggle notebook, the submission file output that is generated will be based on the small set of 400 videos/ids contained within this Public Validation Set. This is available on the Kaggle Data page as test_videos.zip\n",
    "\n",
    "**Public Test Set:** This dataset is completely withheld and is what Kaggle’s platform computes the public leaderboard against. When you “Submit to Competition” from the “Output” file of a committed notebook that contains the competition’s dataset, your code will be re-run in the background against this Public Test Set. When the re-run is complete, the score will be posted to the public leaderboard. If the re-run fails, you will see an error reflected in your “My Submissions” page. Unfortunately, we are unable to surface any details about your error, so as to prevent error-probing. *You are limited to 2 submissions per day, including submissions with errors.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Private Test Set:** This dataset is privately held outside of Kaggle’s platform, and is used to compute the private leaderboard. It contains videos with a similar format and nature as the Training and Public Validation/Test Sets, but are real, organic videos with and without deepfakes. After the competition deadline, Kaggle transfers your 2 final selected submissions’ code to the host. They will re-run your code against this private dataset and return prediction submissions back to Kaggle for computing your final private leaderboard scores."
